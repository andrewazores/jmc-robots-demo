# jmc-robots-demo

To run the demo for a quick smoketest, run `./gradlew run` in the project
subdirectories, each in a new terminal instance, in the following order:

RobotMakerExpress2000
RobotController
RobotShop

For a Docker containerized test, run `sh build.sh` then `sh run.sh` in the root
of this project.
